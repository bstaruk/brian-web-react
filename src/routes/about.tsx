            These days, I am building almost exclusively with React, TypeScript
            and Tailwind on the front-end. I used to roll my own Webpack configs
            (

            ) for everything, but now I use Vite for SPAs (like this one) and
            Next.js for everything else. On the back-end, I&apos;m mostly using
            Node.js, TypeScript, Fastify or Express, and Postgres.

            and most of my attention is focused on that project, but I&apos;ll
            be working on this domain when I feel like being more creative and

            This project will be a collection of mini-apps. I have a bad habit
            of buying domains with plans of grandeur, only to abandon them in
            the <abbr title="Minimally Viable Product">MVP</abbr> stage like{' '}
